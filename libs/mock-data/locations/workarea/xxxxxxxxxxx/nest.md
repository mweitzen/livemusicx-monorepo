**Removed:**

- Removed Northwest as a major region since Northeast and Mid-Atlantic encompass these areas.

**Notes:**

- The list initially has "Northwest" for some Mid-Atlantic locations. This is geographically inaccurate.
- "Megalopolis" refers to a large, continuously developed urban corridor. It's not a common term for a region but can be informative.
- The Appalachian Trail is a long-distance hiking trail that stretches through multiple states. Specific locations along the trail can be sub-sub-regions.
- Consider reorganizing the list based on your intended use. Separating Northeast and Mid-Atlantic might be helpful.

I hope this corrected and reorganized breakdown is more accurate and useful!
