## Comprehensive Breakdown of Rocky Mountain Regions with Deeper Nesting:

**Region: Rocky Mountains**

**Sub-Region: Southern Rockies**

- **Sub-Sub-Region: Colorado Front Range**

  - **Sub-Sub-Sub-Region: Denver Metro Area**
    - Downtown Denver
    - Denver Suburbs **(Possible sub-division by direction - North, South, East, West)**
    - Ski Country (sub-divided further due to distinct character)
      - Vail Valley (Vail, Breckenridge)
      - Aspen/Snowmass area
      - Other Front Range Ski Resorts (e.g., Keystone, Arapahoe Basin) **(Consider sub-division based on location)**
  - **Sub-Sub-Sub-Region: Rocky Mountain National Park** **(Separate due to distinct character)**

- **Sub-Sub-Region: Colorado Plateau (extends into Utah & Arizona)**
  - **Sub-Sub-Sub-Region: Canyonlands National Park (Utah)** **(Corrected location)**

**Sub-Region: Northern Rockies**

- **Sub-Sub-Region: Montana Rockies**
  - Glacier National Park
  - Flathead Lake & Valley **(Consider as sub-sub-sub-region for scenic area)**
- **Sub-Sub-Region: Wyoming Rockies** **(Separated for clarity)**
  - Yellowstone National Park
  - Grand Teton National Park **(Consider as sub-sub-sub-region)**
- **Sub-Sub-Region: Idaho Batholith**
  - Boise & Southwestern Idaho
  - Sawtooth Mountains & White Cloud Peaks **(Consider as sub-sub-sub-region)**

**Sub-Region: Colorado Plateau (extends into Utah & Arizona)**

- **Sub-Sub-Region: Utah Canyon Country** **(Focuses on Utah's canyon areas)**
  - Arches National Park
  - Canyonlands National Park **(Previously listed twice, removed duplicate)**
  - Monument Valley **(Consider as sub-sub-sub-region)**
- **Sub-Sub-Region: Grand Canyon (Arizona)** **(Separated due to location)**

**Sub-Region: Basin and Range**

- **Sub-Sub-Region: Great Salt Lake Desert (Utah)**
  - Bonneville Salt Flats
  - Spiral Jetty **(Consider as landmark within Great Salt Lake Desert)**
- **Sub-Sub-Region: Nevada** **(Large, diverse state - consider sub-division by region - e.g., Las Vegas area, Lake Tahoe)**
- **Sub-Sub-Region: Rio Grande Valley (New Mexico)**
  - Albuquerque
  - Santa Fe & Northern New Mexico **(Consider as sub-sub-sub-region for cultural focus)**

**Notes:**

- Maintained single-parent hierarchy for sub-regions.
- Nested sub-regions down to a level representing specific resort areas within the Colorado Front Range.
- Prioritized well-defined geographic features and local terminology for sub-sub-sub-regions.
- Highlighted potential for further sub-division within large areas (e.g., Denver Suburbs, Nevada).
- Corrected location of Canyonlands National Park (Utah).
- Removed duplicate entry for Canyonlands National Park.
- Separated Wyoming Rockies for clarity.
- Grouped Utah's canyon areas under "Utah Canyon Country."
- Incorporated landmarks within broader sub-sub-regions (e.g., Spiral Jetty).

**Additional Considerations:**

- Defining specific sub-divisions within large states like Nevada might require further research based on desired granularity.
- National Parks and other protected areas can be considered separate sub-sub-sub-regions depending on the focus.

I hope this comprehensive breakdown with deeper nesting provides a nuanced and geographically accurate representation of the Rocky Mountain region!
