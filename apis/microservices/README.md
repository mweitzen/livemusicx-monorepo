## Music Networking Platform: A Microservices-Based App for Live Events (NestJS, Docker, RabbitMQ, WebSockets)

**In Progress: A Scalable Live Music Connection Platform**

This repository is under active development and serves as the foundation for a robust music networking platform designed to connect musicians, venues, and music enthusiasts for live entertainment experiences beyond traditional stage shows (restaurants, wineries, etc.). Built on a microservices architecture with NestJS, Docker, RabbitMQ, and WebSockets, this application aims to foster vibrant musical communities through a scalable and performant architecture.

**Technical Overview:**

- **Microservices Architecture:** The application is divided into independent, well-defined microservices, each responsible for a specific functionality (e.g., User Management, Event Management, Content Management). This promotes modularity, scalability, and easier maintenance.
- **NestJS Framework:** Leverages NestJS, a popular TypeScript framework for building efficient and scalable Node.js applications.
- **Docker Containerization:** Employs Docker containers to package and isolate microservices, facilitating deployment across different environments.
- **RabbitMQ for Communication:** Utilizes RabbitMQ as a message broker for asynchronous communication between microservices, ensuring loose coupling and fault tolerance.
- **WebSockets for Real-Time:** Implements WebSockets to enable real-time features like chat functionalities within the platform.
- **REST & GraphQL API Gateways:** Exposes well-defined RESTful and GraphQL APIs through API gateways, allowing client applications to interact with the platform's functionalities.

**Getting Started (Development Environment Setup):**

**Prerequisites:**

- **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** Ensure you have Node.js (version 16 or later) and npm (or yarn) installed on your development machine.
- **Docker:** Install and configure Docker according to the official documentation ([https://docs.docker.com/](https://docs.docker.com/)):
- **Code Editor or IDE:** Choose a preferred code editor or IDE (Visual Studio Code, WebStorm, etc.)

**Setting Up Your Development Environment:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-networking-platform.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd music-networking-platform
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define essential environment variables for your database connection, authentication services, notification channels, and other configurations. You can use a sample `.env.example` file as a reference and populate it with your specific values.

   **Example (.env.example):**

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/database
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   NOTIFICATION_GATEWAY_URL=...
   # ... other environment variables
   ```

4. **Run database migrations:**

   ```bash
   npm run migrate  # or yarn migrate
   ```

   This command creates or updates database tables based on your models.

5. **Start the application:**

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev  # or yarn start:dev
   ```

   This will start all microservices in development mode, allowing you to interact with the platform through the API gateways.

**Development Workflow:**

- Each microservice resides in its own subdirectory with its own `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` files.
- Use NestJS command-line tools for development tasks within each microservice directory:
  - `npm run build` (or `yarn build`) to build the microservice for production.
  - `npm run start` (or `yarn start`) to start the microservice in development mode.
  - `npm run test` (or `yarn test`) to run unit and integration tests for the microservice.
- Utilize Docker for containerization and easier deployment. Docker Compose configuration files (`.docker-compose.yml`) are provided to manage starting multiple microservices simultaneously. You can run `docker-compose up -d` to start all services in the background.

**Testing:**

Unit and integration tests are encouraged for each microservice to ensure code quality and functionality. Utilize testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha for comprehensive coverage.
