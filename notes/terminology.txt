 - Generally Unimportant to Need to Understand

USER - A person that uses the application
    Users can be:
        Anonymous -> no account
        Public -> have an account to save preferences
        Authorized -> have an account to post events and connect with other ACCOUNTS

USER ACCOUNT - An authentication account associated with a single person that is logged in. 
    The user account is relatively meaningless in the scope of the application 
    other than to uniquely identify the person using the app. 
    A user account can be:
        Public -> only manages personal account and preferences. slightly elevated app experience than anonymous.
        Performer -> manage MUSICIAN ACCOUNTS and GROUP ACCOUNTS
        Venue -> manage VENUE ACCOUNTS
        Organizer -> manage ORGANIZER ACCOUNTS
        Associate -> invite only to organization accounts that can manage that organization resources.

ORGANIZATION ACCOUNT - an authentication-based, organization account that allows multiple USER ACCOUNTS to share access to resources.
    Organizations are used to manage:
        Groups
        Venues
        Organizers

ORGANIZATION ACCOUNT - an authentication-based, organization account that allows multiple USER ACCOUNTS to share access to resources.
    Organizations are used to manage:
        Groups
        Venues
        Organizers
        
ACCOUNT - a single account that represents a performer, venue, or organizer in the event management process.
    Accounts can be: managed or unmanaged
    Managed accounts - are created or claimed by a user matching their user account type.
    Unmanaged accounts - are created when a user creates an event and adds an account that is not yet created.
        -- example: A venue creates an event, and adds a musician John Doe that does not already have an account in the app.
            -> the account John Doe will be created and populated with sensible defaults.
            -> an invite will be sent to that user to join
            -> that account remains unmanaged until a USER with a USER ACCOUNT claims John Doe
    Accounts can be:
        Musician -> Managed by a Performer USER ACCOUNT
        Group -> Managed by a Performer USER ACCOUNT
        Venue -> Managed by a Venue USER ACCOUNT
        Organizer -> Managed by an Organizer USER ACCOUNT

AFFILIATION - a relationship between different account types where they often engage in mutual events together

AFFILIATION REQUEST - sent by one account to another account based on the basis that the two accounts already have an existing relationship,
    but have not yet created the affiliation in the app.
    affiliation requests are one-to-one requests

AFFILIATION REQUEST MESSAGE THREAD

INQUIRY - a precursor to an AFFILIATION REQUEST if no current relationship exists. A request sent from one account type to another account type
    asking about developing a relationship and possibly working together. Which would lead to an eventual AFFILIATION REQUEST when both accounts agree.
    Inquiries are one-to-one requests.

INQUIRY MESSAGE THREAD

BULLETIN - A publicly broadcasted post, similar to an INQUIRY, but made by one account type seeking requests from many interested accounts.
    Bulletins are one-to-many requests

BULLETIN RESPONSE THREAD
