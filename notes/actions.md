### Event Creation and Management

- Events can be created by musicians, venues, or organizers.
- If a musician creates an event and adds a venue or organizer:
  - If the venue/organizer is a managed account, the event will be temporarily held until they review and accept it.
  - If the venue/organizer is not managed, the event will be created, and they may be notified by email.
- The hierarchy of ownership for an event is: Organizer (if attached and managed) > Venue (if attached and managed) > Musician.
- Any edit can be made by any account in the hierarchy, but it will not take effect until accepted by the highest managed account.
