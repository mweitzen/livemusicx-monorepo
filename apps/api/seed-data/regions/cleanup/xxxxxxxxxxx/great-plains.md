## Comprehensive Breakdown of Great Plains Regions with Deep Nesting:

**Region: Great Plains**

**Sub-Region: Missouri Coteau**

- **Sub-Sub-Region: Northern Great Plains Coteau**

    - Milk River Valley (including Havre, Malta)
  - **Sub-Sub-Sub-Region: North Dakota Coteau**
    - Pembina Hills (including Pembina, Cavalier)

**Sub-Region: Great Plains**

- **Sub-Sub-Region: Northern Great Plains**

  - **Sub-Sub-Sub-Region: Eastern Montana Plains**
    - Fort Peck Lake Region (including Glasgow, Fort Peck)
    - Glendive & Montana Badlands (including Glendive, Makoshika State Park)
  - **Sub-Sub-Sub-Region: North Dakota Plains**
    - Red River Valley (including Fargo, Grand Forks)
    - Missouri River Valley (including Bismarck, Mandan)
    - Devils Lake Region (including Devils Lake, Spirit Lake)
  - **Sub-Sub-Sub-Region: South Dakota (West)**
    - Black Hills (including Rapid City, Mount Rushmore)
    - Badlands National Park

- **Sub-Sub-Region: Central Great Plains**

  - **Sub-Sub-Sub-Region: South Dakota (East)**
    - Sioux Falls & Eastern Prairies (including Sioux Falls, Madison)
    - James River Valley (including Huron, Aberdeen)
  - **Sub-Sub-Sub-Region: Nebraska**
    - Sandhills (central Nebraska)
    - Corn Belt (eastern Nebraska - consider sub-division for major cities like Lincoln, Omaha)
    - Missouri River Valley (including Omaha, Council Bluffs)
  - **Sub-Sub-Sub-Region: Kansas (excluding Flint Hills)**
    - High Plains (western Kansas)
    - Smoky Hills (central Kansas)
    - Kansas River Valley (including Topeka, Lawrence)
    - Eastern Prairies (consider sub-division for Wichita metro area)

- **Sub-Sub-Region: Southern Great Plains**
  - **Sub-Sub-Sub-Region: Kansas Flint Hills**
    - Tallgrass Prairie Preserve (Chase & Greenwood Counties)
    - Flint Hills National Scenic Byway (various counties)
  - **Sub-Sub-Sub-Region: Oklahoma Panhandle**
    - Oklahoma Panhandle Grasslands (including Guymon, Dalhart)
    - Canadian River Valley (including Woodward, Enid)

**Sub-Region: Tallgrass Prairie**

- Flint Hills (Kansas) **(Already included in Southern Great Plains for location)**
- Osage Plains (Oklahoma) **(Consider sub-division for Tulsa metro area)**

**Notes:**

- Maintained single-parent hierarchy for sub-regions.
- Nested sub-regions down to a level representing neighborhoods would be impractical for such a vast area. This breakdown reaches a balance between detail and manageability.
- Focused on well-defined geographic features and recognized regions for sub-sub-sub-regions.
- Included major cities and points of interest within sub-sub-sub-regions.
- Highlighted potential for further sub-division within Kansas (Corn Belt, Eastern Prairies) and Oklahoma (Osage Plains, Tulsa metro).

**Additional Considerations:**

- Specific boundaries, especially for sub-sub-sub-regions, can vary depending on chosen criteria. This breakdown prioritizes commonly recognized regions and landmarks.
- Resources like state tourism boards and US Geological Survey maps can be helpful for further refinement.

I hope this comprehensive breakdown with deep nesting provides a nuanced and geographically accurate representation of the Great Plains!
