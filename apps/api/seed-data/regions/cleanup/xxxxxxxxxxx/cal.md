**Notes:**

- Included potential sub-divisions within Los Angeles Metro and San Fernando Valley for further detail.
- Removed "Greater Los Angeles" as a sub-region due to redundancy.
- Clarified "San Diego & Deserts" to focus on Coachella Valley and Death Valley as distinct desert areas.
- Separated Channel Islands National Park from Central Coast due to its island location.
- Maintained single-parent hierarchy for sub-regions.

**Additional Considerations:**

- Defining specific sub-divisions within Los Angeles Metro and San Fernando Valley requires further research based on desired granularity.
- National Parks within the Sierra Nevada can be included as sub-sub-regions.
- "Central Coast & Channel Islands" can be helpful for broader marketing purposes, but they are geographically distinct areas.
