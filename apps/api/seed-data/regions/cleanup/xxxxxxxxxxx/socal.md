**Notes:**

- Maintained single-parent hierarchy for sub-regions.
- Nested sub-regions down to a level representing neighborhoods within major metro areas (Los Angeles).
- Prioritized well-defined geographic areas and local terminology for sub-sub-sub-regions.
- Highlighted potential for further sub-division within major metro areas (Los Angeles).
- Separated "Los Angeles Metro" from "Los Angeles & Hollywood" for clarity.
- Combined Hollywood & West Hollywood due to their close proximity.
- Separated San Fernando Valley from "Los Angeles Metro" due to its distinct character.
- Grouped "Coastal Orange County" beaches for manageability (sub-division possible).
- Clarified "San Diego City & Beaches" for better understanding.
- Separated Tijuana information for clarity and labeled "Informational only."

**Additional Considerations:**

- Defining specific neighborhood boundaries within Los Angeles and other major cities can be complex. Further research or local knowledge might be necessary.
- This breakdown focuses on areas with a reasonable commute time for day trips or weekend getaways.

I hope this comprehensive breakdown with deeper nesting provides a nuanced and geographically accurate representation of Southern California!
